Questloop Adventure

Created by Ryne Bigueras

This project can show simple coding but have a complex looking outcome.
It shows basic codes and functions that can be broken down and taught to people that
want to learn how to read and wrtite codes.

renaming statments
input() statments
print() statments
=, ==, operators
import random
random.randint
if, else statments
def funtions

are statments and operators that are used in this program.
It is simple enough and doesn't use complex coding The end of the game
is really not an end but a loop. As the future expands in this game, you are to
keep questing until you reach a character level. Until then you the game will
keep looping chapter 5 and depending on your health do different quests.
Manually terminate the program to end it.

This code is hosted on https://github.com/MasterPnut/Questloop-Adventure

Using the program python and IDLE to edit codes.

Places where to learn what scripts, functions, operators work and how to use them.

Install python from 
www.python.org
use the installer that corresponds with your OS.

Download the Questloop Adventure from Github
Locate file
And double click it. Python program should regocnize and run it.

To see how the code looks and/or edit it
Python should have installed IDLE as well.
Open IDLE and on the top File/Open/file location.
Here it will open it as a file that can be edited.
